		In the world of digital photography postproduction of your photos are especially important. Fixing blemishes and the skin on your model is necessary. Imperfections can be very distracting and will take away from what you are trying to show.

		<h3>Removing Blemishes</h3>

			Fixing the more obvious blemishes and wrinkles should be the first thing you do. This creates a cleaner image for you to work with. An important tool that is very simple to use is the healing brush tool.

			1.	First, you're going to need to create a new layer by selecting the new layer icon. <img src = "new layer icon.png" alt="newlayer"><br>
